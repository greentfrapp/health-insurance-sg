    "question": "lasik coverage in ntuc income in a table format with cited quotes",
    "text": "Based on the provided documents, LASIK surgery is explicitly excluded from coverage under NTUC Income's Enhanced IncomeShield and IncomeShield plans.  The Schedule of Benefits lists \"lasik treatments\" among exclusions, alongside routine eye examinations and costs for spectacles and contact lenses <cite> <doc>60c8516dIncome2024 pages 20-20 quote1</doc> <doc>60c8516dIncome2024 pages 20-22 quote1</doc></cite>.  This exclusion is clearly stated, indicating that elective vision correction procedures like LASIK are not covered unless specifically endorsed by the policy <cite> <doc>60c8516dIncome2024 pages 20-22 quote2</doc></cite>.  The Enhanced IncomeShield brochures do not mention LASIK coverage <cite><doc>60c8516dEnhanced2024 pages 12-15</doc> <doc>60c8516dEnhanced2024 pages 1-4</doc> <doc>60c8516dEnhanced2024 pages 16-17</doc></cite>.  Therefore, a table summarizing LASIK coverage would simply show \"No coverage\" for both plans.",
